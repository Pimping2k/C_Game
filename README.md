I made a card game "Fool" Where there are 2 players, each initially having 6 cards. There is a deck of 36 cards in which the card values ​​are from 6 to Ace and 4 suits - ♥♦♣♠.

Each player has the option of whether he can return the card or not; if the player can return the card that the opponent threw to him, then the turn goes to him. A move can only be made with 1 card. The winner is the player who first discarded his last card.

The players have names so that it is clearly visible which of them throws the card. In fact, we play for both players.
